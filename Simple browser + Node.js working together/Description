This is a simple project example that demonstrates browser + Node.js working together (like a frontend page sending data to a Node backend)
 Goal:
We’ll create a small system where:
Frontend (Browser JavaScript) → sends data (your name).
Backend (Node.js JavaScript) → receives and responds with a message.
